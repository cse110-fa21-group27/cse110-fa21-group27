# ESLint on VSCode

- Status: Accepted

## Context and Problem Statement

How can we catch more errors at the source of development so that linting takes less time overall?  
We need at least some form of linting on developers' local environments to catch more errors at the source.  
Codacy catches lots of errors, but it is not great at fixing such errors.  
Also, Codacy reports style errors which reflects an inaccurate number of fatal issues with our code.

## Considered Options

- option 1: fix flag, Codacy
- option 2: use less linting
- option 3: add ESLint to local development environment

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: option 3  
Reasoning: makes linting more efficient in a local environment

### Positive Consequences

- catch more errors when they are easy to fix in the moment
- faster than Codacy

### Negative Consequences

- redundant when coupled with Codacy (which runs integrated ESLint checks)
