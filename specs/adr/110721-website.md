## Context and Problem Statement

For the first MVP, should we implement a website or mobile application?

## Decision Drivers

* The foundation of the project rests on this choice.
* Every design choice needs to be made with the application choice in mind.

## Considered Options

* Website Application
* Mobile Application

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Website Application, because it is easier to implement, more reasonable to test, and can be used by any device with Internet connection.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### {Website Application}
* Good, because it is easier to test a website. Can easily pull up DevTools on website.
* Good, because websites can be opened on any device with Internet.
* Good, because the primary use of websites is on Computers or laptops which have bigger screen space.
* Good, because it is easier to implement a website in the time frame available.
* Bad, because it is harder to use websites in a kitchen when they are primarily run on desktops and laptops.

### {Mobile Application}

* Good, because the mobility of mobile devices are easy to use in kitchens.
* Bad, because harder to test on mobile. Cannot easily pull up DevTools on mobile device.
* Bad, because it limits the application to just mobile devices.
* Bad, because mobile devices inherently have smaller screen space.
* Bad, because it is harder to implement a mobile application in the time frame available.
