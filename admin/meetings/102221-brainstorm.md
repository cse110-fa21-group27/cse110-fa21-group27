### Agenda
Group Split into two:
- One working on Features, App Research, Purpose
- One working on User Thinking and User Personas


### Group A: Arturo, Steven C., Delia, Tucker

### Problem Exploration
<p>The basic cook, want something simple for people that aren't too ambitious cooking</p>
- college students
- professors
- nurses that don't have too much time

### Features:
- Include a timer as part of the step to allow an all in one functionality
- Collapsable instructions so as to support peoples focus -- make it easy for people
- recipes display depending on the time - ex: inspiration for breakfast at 07:00
- recipe of the day - allow for prettier format on display page
- something simplistic for layout -- no shadow backgrounds on images to look sleek
- author (who invented the recipe) - giving credit to authors? 
- list of tools for recipe 
- checkbox next to ingredients & a functionality to print off list of ones not checked(grocery list)
- abiility to plan recipe for the week
- make recipe "collections" where you can categorise the recipes -- ex: may have a halloween collection for recipes someone wants to make for a halloween party
- export functionality (printing/sending the recipe)
- Calorie/nutrition facts at the bottom of the page so people can choose to be informed
- allergen information so it's easy to spot for people that suffer with deathly allergies
- Ingredient substitutions for common ingredients that they be missing, so it will be easier for people to make the most of what they already have (could potentially also help ppl that are allergic to common ingredients)
<p>As the features were thought out, it tried to make each part accessible to people in a way that was currently lacking. For instance, many people have difficulty focusing on recipe instructions and many platforms do not support their focus. In addition, for people that struggle planning, we wanted a solution for them to be able to become more organised in a simple manner.</p>
