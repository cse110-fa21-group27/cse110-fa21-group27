### Agenda

New Business:

- To achieve the MVP (Minimum Viable Product):
  - Create a Search Page JS Component
  - Create a Search Function that takes input from NavBar whenever the icon is clicked
  - Create a Saved Recipe JS Component so that Users can see all their saved recipes in one place
  - Create a Road Map JS Component (Selling Point of the Project) that guides users through learning how to cook
    - It should provide a map of progressively harder recipes that will teach the user different skills in cooking
  - Finish up the CI/CD Pipeline so that testing is done on the components
- Check Github for updated Issues and teammates to work on them with. Ask questions early and often before getting frustrated.

Future Business:

- Tidy up CSS
- Filtering Search Result
- Grocery List
- Adjusting quantity of ingredients
- Nutrition button on RecipeInfo.js?
- Saved Recipe Collections?

Meeting concluded at 3:15PM.
