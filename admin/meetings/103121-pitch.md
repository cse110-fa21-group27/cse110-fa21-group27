New Business:

- Wireframes

  - Collapsable side bar with
  - Simple search bars
  - Button to add ingredients to grocery lists
  - Have saved recipes quick and easy to access
- Decide on "Selling point" of Recipe Manager
  - Agreed on a "game" style of a map with recipes that gradually increase in difficulty.
  - It would teach the user to cook, teach them different techniques and things.
  - It could award them "experience" by keeping track of how many recipes they have accomplished.
  - Would provide a subtle incentive for others to keep learning and bettering their skills
  - Could also be completely ignored if people choose to.

Meeting concluded at 2:45PM.
