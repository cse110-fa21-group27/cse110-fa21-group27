New Business:
- Delia worked on the navigation component with Steven C, helped the testers, and helped manage/guide the daily standups.
- Dilara and Tiffany created high quality wireframes with FIGMA to better outline how the web app is going to look like. In addition they both started working on the directions component.
- Steven S. and Arturo were working on pipeline with incorporating JSDocs and introducing another linter to meet the specifications of our code quality tool Codacy.

- Miguel worked on the back-end, connecting all the different components on the page and making sure they all function.
