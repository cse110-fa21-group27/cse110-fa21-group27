### Agenda
Group Split into two:
 one working on features/purpose

Who: 

Group A: Arturo, Steven C., Tucker


Group B: Aryan, Delia, Kevin, Miguel, Steven S

### User Stories: 
<p>Describe why each feature should be used - who could use each feature/why it should be added. Most of the people creating the stories were not the ones to have created the ideas of the features, so they bring a fresh perspective and will also be able to become closer to the parts other people have been working on. 

Format for a user story: As a ___ I want to ____ so that ____. 
The goal here is to make sure are app is user centered. We are trying to put ourselves in the user's shoes because they are the ones that will be using the app and their preferences are extremely important as we go </p>

List of some of user stories(the full extensive list can be found on the miro doc): 
- As an easily distracted parent I want to have a timer in the app so that I don't have to worry about forgetting to start it or setting it for the wrong amount of time.
- As a party host I want to be able to sort all of the recipes I plan to use so that I can organise the party easily.
- As a person that lives in a small apartment I want to filter recipes based on my available cooking tools so that I can make use of the small kitchen.

After creating the user stories for the features, we are better able to see why the features would be useful and see their importance to the app. After creating a thorough list of the features, we can now be better equipped to narrow the features. 


### Feature Narrowing: 
<p>Help to describe which features should be implemented and give priority to different features so that it can help guide the process of what and when things begin to get done. A key for the miro board is green, yellow, and red which help to describe the importance of the features and help us to decide which should get implemented first.\<p>


Next Steps:
- Wireframe
- UML
- 
Meeting concluded at TIME.
