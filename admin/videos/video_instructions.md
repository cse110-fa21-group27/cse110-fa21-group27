Team Intro Video
You also should make a small 2.5 minute (max) video (MP4 or Quicktime format) that introduces your team.  Again, have fun with this as you see fit.  Each TA will pick the best video of their group to show in class and that team will receive bonus points for the selection so there is an incentive to excel here.

Your video should live in you repo at /admin/videos/teamintro.mp4 (whether or not the video is ever uploaded to YouTube, please get the original asset here in the repo, compressed if necessary).

Cora will get back to us if the entire team needs to be present in the video or not.
The verdict is that we are encouraging you all to have at least one narrator but it's okay if you just have music/text.
