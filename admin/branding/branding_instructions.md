Team Brand

An important part of team forming is developing a team identity and brand. Your will need to choose a team name and build a brand or theme around it. Branding materials could include (don't feel pressured to do all of these) team colors, a logo, a mascot, custom fonts, power point themes, etc. You should use these branding materials on future presentations and assignments to reinforce your team identity to the class. Additionally you should set your slack workspace icon to an image that represents your brand and also incorporates your team number prominently.

Remember to keep any images/documents in admin/branding.
